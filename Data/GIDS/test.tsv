Although he was instructed by his father in engraving, he did not follow his example, either in the style of his execution, or in the size of his plates. He appears to have studied and to have formed his manner from the works of Lucas van Leyden. His compositions are abundant, but he wanted taste in the selection of his forms. He finished his plates very neatly with the graver; but there is not much effect in his prints, from his ignorance of the management of the chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding this defect, which was very general at the time in which he lived, his works possess considerable merit. He died at Amsterdam in 1656.

This first act of this rebellion was marked by two events: Andrew_Moray proclaiming his defiance of English rule at Avoch; and the murder of William Hesilrig, the English sheriff of Lanark, on 3rd May, 1297, during an attack on the town led by William Wallace and Richard Lundie. News of Moray's actions quickly drew supporters to him. Alexander Pilchie, a burgess from Inverness, and a number of other burgesses from the town were amongst his earliest supporters. Although Sir Andrew Moray of Petty remained imprisoned in the Tower_of_London - where he apparently died as King Edward's prisoner - many of his tenants willingly joined his son. Sir William fitz Warin, the English constable of Urquhart Castle on the shores of Loch Ness, wrote to King Edward in July 1297: ``Some evil disposed people have joined Andrew Moray at the castle of Avoch in Ross.'' ###END###
